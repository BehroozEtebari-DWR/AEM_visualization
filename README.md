# AEM_visualization
Introduction This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks designed for organizing and analyzing AEM inverted data available on the CNRA OPEN DATA platform ([DWR](https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/aem)). The notebooks streamline the process of handling, visualizing, and interpreting AEM datasets for efficient data-driven decision-making.
The first notebook enables you to read and organize the XYZ inverted smoothed interpretation data efficiently.
The second notebook converts the organized data into VTK format, making it ready for visualization in ParaView.
These tools streamline the workflow for managing, analyzing, and visualizing AEM datasets, offering an accessible approach to geospatial data interpretation.
